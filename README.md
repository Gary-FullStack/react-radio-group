Here is an example of building a radio group component in React.


The API for the RadioGroup component is defined as two props: selected, which is a string that matches one of the RadioOption values and onChange, which is the event that gets called whenever a selection changes, providing the new value as an argument.

Using React.Children.map will allow me to iterate over the sibling elements.


Simple and effected use of logic and react ewlements.
